  "There's no 'should' or 'should not' when it comes to having feelings. They're part of who we are and their origins are beyond our control. When we can believe that, we may find it easier to make constructive choices about what to do with those feelings.",
  "There is no normal life that is free of pain. It's the very wrestling with our problems that can be the impetus for our growth.",
  'Confronting our feelings and giving them appropriate expression always takes strength, not weakness. \n \nIt takes strength to acknowledge our anger, and sometimes more strength yet to curb the aggressive urges anger may bring and to channel them into nonviolent outlets. \n \nIt takes strength to face our sadness and to grieve and to let our grief and our anger flow in tears when they need to. \n \nIt takes strength to talk about our feelings and to reach out for help and comfort when we need it.',
  'In times of stress, the best thing we can do for each other is to listen with our ears and our hearts and to be assured that our questions are just as important as our answers.',
  'Anything that’s human is mentionable, and anything that is mentionable can be more manageable. When we can talk about our feelings, they become less overwhelming, less upsetting, and less scary. \n \n The people we trust with that important talk can help us know that we are not alone.'
